                        I am currently in my third year of the Visual Arts and Computer Science Combined Major program at the University of Victoria. This interdisciplinary field has inspired me to continue bridging the gap between technical and creative subjects, and has given me the tools and skills I need to succeed in both areas. <br/> <br/>
                        In May 2022, I began an eight-month co-op with SaaSquatch as a frontend developer. I learnt how to use Typescript with React in a very short amount of time, and was pushing code to production within the first month of being there! My position at SaaSquatch evolved over time, and I ended up landing the role of Technical Product Analyst. I returned to classes in January 2023 and was hired part-time at SaaSquatch. My two positions at SaaSquatch have given me well-rounded knowledge of the SaaS industry, as I have worked with all departments, ranging from engineering to marketing, to product management.
