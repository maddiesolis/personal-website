# Personal Website
Developed March, 2023.

## Tech Stack
React app using Typescript.

## Description
This website was built to serve as a virtual resume by showcasing my work experience, skills, and personal interests. The aim was to practice my UI/UX design skills in Figma as well as my frontend development skills, so I prioritized the visual styling, navigation, and incorporating some interactive components.

## Implementation
On the technical side, my goal was to keep a clean and maintainable codebase.

- **Styled components**: I used styled-components to keep styles modular and easy to manage. It helps keep styling with the components, avoids global CSS conflicts, and makes it simple to update styles dynamically.
- **SVGs**: I used SVGs for icons and graphics because they are scalable, lightweight, and maintain high quality at any size. They also allow for easy customization, like changing colors, without losing clarity.
- **React functional components**: I used React functional components because they are simpler, easier to read, and make better use of hooks for state and side effects. They also help keep the code modular and maintainable while improving performance by reducing unnecessary re-renders.

## Coming soon
- Revamp of visual design
- Upgrading the tech stack
- Introducing an admin-facing portal so I can update the site's contents without making code changes
- Potentially introducing a chatbot!
